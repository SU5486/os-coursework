# Week 4 – Initial System Configuration and Security

In Week 4, I configured the Ubuntu Server virtual machine and focused on basic security setup.

I installed and enabled the OpenSSH server to allow secure remote access to the system.
SSH access was tested successfully from the host machine using port forwarding.

I also reviewed the SSH configuration to understand authentication methods such as
password authentication, public key authentication, and root login restrictions.
